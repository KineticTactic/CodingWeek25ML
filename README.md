# Machine Learning Task – Coding Week 25

## 📌 Overview

This project predicts Crowd Energy (0–100) for a rock band’s shows using historical tour data. The dataset is noisy and partially unreliable, so the project focuses on data cleaning, EDA, feature engineering, model tuning, and evaluation. Separate behavior across different venues is explored, as each venue has unique characteristics.

## 🎯 Objectives

- Clean messy data (dates, prices, invalid readings, missing values)

- Perform EDA to understand venue behavior and validate singer’s claims

- Engineer meaningful pre-show features

- Train and tune regression models (Random Forest / Boosting)

- Evaluate using RMSE and R² with cross-validation

- Generate predictions for the test dataset

- (Bonus) Perform revenue optimization for V_Gamma
